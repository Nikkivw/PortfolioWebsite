        This project was originally intended as a full tower defence game, which we had to make as part of a school project. This was my first attempt at a tower defence game until my laptop failed, so eventually this project became a personal project. Since I was not able to make it a full tower defence game, it became just the procedural map generator. I'm still very proud of what I accomplished<br><br>
        This Project is made in Unity Game Engine. the group size is 1 person. the project was made in 2 weeks. And the art is from the free assets store.

          What I learned from this project is that it's not bad to look things up if you don't know them sometimes and that you don't have to prove yourself extra to the people who think you can't do something. Furthermore, with this project I greatly improved my C# and Unity skills and learned new things that I wouldn't have learned in school otherwise. Such as how to use Coroutines and the IEnumerators.<br><br>

          What this project basically does, is it checks every time it places a path block when there is a path block next to it, and when it has sufficient room, it creates a loop. It verifies this through the x and Y coordinates that are attached to the path blocks. If it cannot place a loop, it puts down a regular path block. Once the path is laid, it finishes the map by itself with random scenery blocks that it takes out from a random list.

          The CreateGrid() function is like a supervisor. It calls two other functions, layPathBlocks() and laySceneryBlocks(), and waits for them to finish before proceeding.<br><br>
          In layPathBlocks(), we make the path blocks for the grid. We go through a list of path blocks, find out their orientation, and put them in the grid with the right rotation. Then, we pause for 0.1 seconds before working on the next block.<br><br>
          As for the laySceneryBlocks function, it's all about creating scenery blocks for the grid. We go through the grid's rows and columns, checking if a spot is empty. If it is, we randomly choose a scenery block, place it there, and wait for 0.025 seconds before moving to the next spot.
