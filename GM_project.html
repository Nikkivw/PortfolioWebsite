          You have to see the game like a basic edition of the game "Call of Duty Zombies," minus the zombie. You can pick up items, change weapons, die, and heal. You can also sprint and jump.

          The Update() method is called each frame and listens for the player to press a number key (1, 2, or 3) corresponding to a particular weapon in the player's inventory. When the player presses a number key that corresponds to a weapon other than the one they currently have, the UnequipWeapon() method is called to remove the current weapon and the EquipWeapon(Weapon) method is called to equip the new weapon.<br><br>
          The EquipWeapon(Weapon weapon) method takes a Weapon property as an argument and sets the currentlyEquippedWeapon variable to the new weapon's index. It then sets an integer parameter of an Animator component to the weaponType attribute of the Weapon object, creates a new game object using the prefab property of the Weapon object, and sets the new object's parent to WeaponHolderR. Lastly, it calls the UpdateWeaponUI(weapon) method of the PlayerHUD component with the new Weapon object.<br><br>
          The UnequipWeapon() method plays an animation on the Animator component and destroys the game object of the current weapon.<br><br>
          The GetReferences() method retrieves references to the Animator, Inventory, and PlayerHUD components and sets them to the respective variables anim, inventory, and hud.
