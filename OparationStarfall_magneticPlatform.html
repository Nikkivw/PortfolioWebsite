        The team for this project consisted of 20+ members. My part in the project, along with a classmate, was to make a new game mechanism. Finally, we made a magnetic platform that pulls the drones toward itself whenever the drone is close by.

          In this Project, I was able to improve my understanding of C# and I learned a lot about Version Control and Code Convention, which makes the code cleaner and easier to read. I was struggling a lot in this project with the Code for the force System and the pace at which the Drone is being pulled onto the Platform.

          What the magnetic platform does, it checks if there is an enemy that can be pulled closeby. If it is, it pulls it in. This mechanic is made to be used for puzzles, or to switch something on and off.

          The OnEnter() function is triggered when the script is first turned on. It checks if the Magnetic Platform Object is a suitable object. If it is, it changes the state of the Target Object to "MagneticHoldState." It also links the magnetic platform object to the MagneticPlatform property of the MagneticHoldState for the target object.<br><br>
          The WaitForTransition() Coroutine waits for a specific amount of time and then sends a signal in the object's state machine to indicate that the target object has been successfully pulled to the Magnetic Platform.<br><br>
          The PullTarget() function calculates the direction and strength of the force needed to move the target object based on its position relative to the magnetic platform. It then applies this force to the ForceBody component of the target object, simulating the object's movement through physics.<br><br>
          The IsCorrectPosition() function checks if the target object is within a certain distance from the magnetic platform. If it is, it returns "true," indicating that the target object is in the correct position.
