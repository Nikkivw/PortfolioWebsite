          This project was made with 6 developers in Unity. In this project, I took the role of artist and made all the art in this project. I helped the others when they were stuck on some code or needed help with bugs.

          I struggled in the beginning a lot with making art on a drawing tablet, but I learned a lot about making art digital and adapted quickly into making digital 2D art. 2D art is still not my strong suit but i really learned a lot about the process.

          Here you can see the art I made for the game. I made sure to communicate with the others what they wanted, we wanted a black and white top-down cowboy shooter but as you can see not everything is black and white, I said if only black and white it will be boring or really hard to see what, what was. So, after consultation we decided some pieces needed color.
