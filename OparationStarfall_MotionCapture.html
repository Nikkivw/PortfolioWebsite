        A couch co-op Game made by NeoN Orgins Studio With students.<br><br>
        The team for this project consisted of 20+ members. My part in the project, along with a classmate, was to dive deeper in to motion capture software so that animations are much easier and faster to make.

          for this project we needed to dive deeper in some sort of software me and one other classmate chose to dive deeper in Motion Capture. I chose this because i wanted to know how to work with Motion Capture and how to use the data from it and how to use it in cutscenes and animations in the game.
          Here you can see me and my classmate in the Xsense Motion capture suits and a little further down to it the result in blender on the game model

        <p>
          I learned a lot about Xsense Motion capture how to use ans how to properly export it so you can tweak the motion capture for blender. You cant derectly import the Xsense data in Blender, Blender uses Bianary code for the Fbx files so you need a FBX converter to use the data.
          when you changed the FBX to Binary you can import it you can use a Blender Add-on like Rigify to bake the animation from the xSense to the other gamemodel.

          Here you can see the raw motion capture date on the Player model of the game the Xsense rigs are differend than the game rig so some things need to be twaeked.
